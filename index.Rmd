The **gapfraction** package for **R** was designed for modeling understory light in forests with light-detection-and-ranging (LiDAR) data. In addition to metrics of canopy gap fraction ($P_o$), angular canopy closure (ACC), and vertical canopy cover (VCC), the package implements a new canopy height model (CHM) algorithm, popular individual tree crown (ITC) detection algorithms, and a number of other algorithms that produce useful features for statistical modeling, including the distance of trees from plot center.

While the package was originally intended for processing airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, most of its functions should may work for terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data. The package was produced for one chapter of Adam Erickson's doctoral thesis at University of British Columbia^[Erickson, A. (2017) A hybrid modeling approach to simulating past-century understory solar irradiation in Alberta, Canada. University of British Columbia.]. The **gapfraction** package is designed to be used with LAS or LAZ format point cloud data pre-processed with **LAStools**^[LAStools: http://rapidlasso.com/lastools/], **USDA Fusion**^[USDA Fusion: http://forsys.cfr.washington.edu/fusion/fusionlatest.html], or the new **lidR** package from Jean-Romain Roussel^[lidR: https://github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR]. The package also accepts LAS objects imported from **rLiDAR** by Carlos Silva^[rLiDAR: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rLiDAR/index.html].

The main input to functions are height-normalized point clouds in LAS or LAZ format, typically LiDAR plots corresponding to field plots of similar size. The functions are designed to accept file paths or `data.frame`/`data.table` objects imported with the **lidR** or **rLiDAR** packages. Functions automatically detect whether a path or object is input for the `las` parameter. If using objects created from LAS/LAZ files, the column order and naming conventions must follow those of **lidR** and **rLiDAR**, which together provide a standardized object API for LiDAR data in R, based on the ASPRS LAS specification 1.4. It is highly recommended to use either **lidR** inr R or **LAStools** CLI. For more information on these, view the Pre-processing page on this site.

# Getting started

<br>

## Installation

To install the **gapfraction** package, first ensure that you have a working development environment, as the package depends on the **lidr** package. Required software is listed below.

- Windows: `Rtools.exe`
- Mac: `Xcode`
- Linux: `R development branch` (e.g., r-devel or r-base-dev)

Next, install **gapfraction** from the R command line:

```
devtools::install_github("adam-erickson/gapfraction", dependencies=TRUE)
```

<br>

## Example data

After loading the **gapfraction** package with `library(gapfraction)`, the example data can be loaded by calling `data(las)`. The included data consists of an example 100-meter circular radius LiDAR plot with synthetic $X,Y,Z$ coordinates in UTM 11N and height in meters, along with 8-bit unsigned interger values for intensity and return number. Based on previous research, I recommend using plots minimally of this size for comparison to ground data (e.g., hemispherical photography) to capture edge effects.

Let's get started!

```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=6, fig.height=6, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)
```

```{r lastable, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
require(gapfraction)
data(las)
knitr::kable(head(las,10))
```

Once the data is loaded, you can proceed to call functions from the `gapfraction` package.

## Example usage

#### Computing hemispherical Voronoi gap fraction

```{r Phv, echo=3:4, messages=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, verbose=FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.width=6, fig.height=6.5}
require(gapfraction)
data(las)
P.hv(las=las, model="equidist", thresh.val=1.25, thresh.var="height", reprojection=NA,
     pol.deg=5, azi.deg=45, col="height", plots=T, plots.each=F, plots.save=F)
```

#### Comparison of canopy height model (CHM) algorithms

```{r chmplots, echo=3:4, messages=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, verbose=FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
require(gapfraction)
data(las)
chm(las)
chm.sf(las)
```

#### Performing individual tree crown (ITC) detection on a CHM with the standard variable-window and watershed algorithms; both allow user-provided height-to-crown-radius functions

```{r stditc, echo=4:5, messages=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, verbose=FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
require(gapfraction)
data(las)
chm  <- chm.sf(las, silent=TRUE)
mw   <- itc.mw(chm, ht2rad=function(x) 0.15746*x)
wat  <- itc.wat(chm, ht2rad=function(x) 0.15746*x)
```

#### Creating a stacked pit-free CHM and performing individual tree crown (ITC) detection with the hierarchical variable-window and watershed algorithms; these also allow users to input empirical height-to-crown-radius functions

```{r hieritc, echo=4:5, messages=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, verbose=FALSE}
require(gapfraction)
data(las)
chm  <- chm.sf(las, stacked=TRUE, silent=TRUE)
mw   <- itc.mw.h(chm, ht2rad=function(x) 0.15746*x, silent=TRUE)
wat  <- itc.wat.h(chm, ht2rad=function(x) 0.15746*x, silent=TRUE)
```

The `itc` algorithms store values for `trees` and `crown.area` in a two-element named numeric vector.
