The **gapfraction** package implements a new barycentric interpolation spike-free canopy height model (CHM) algorithm based on Khosravipour et al. (2013)^[Khosravipour et al. (2013) Development of an algorithm to generate a LiDAR pit-free canopy height model. http://www.riegl.com/uploads/tx_pxpriegldownloads/khosravipour_SilviLaser2013.pdf] and (2016)^[Khosravipour et al. (2016) Generating spike-free digital surface models using LiDAR raw point clouds: A new approach for forestry applications. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243416300873], in addition to two new LiDAR metrics of canopy gap fraction ($P_o$), several individual tree crown (ITC) detection algorithms, canopy distance and direction metrics, effective leaf area index ($L_e$) and apparent clumping index ($ACI$) estimation methods. Four mathematical fisheye (hemispherical) lens models are implemented: equi-angular, equi-distant, stereographic, and orthographic. Finally, a new `radial.grid` function is included for polar plots, while a modified sun path plotting function is also provided. An alphabetical list of functions contained in the **gapfraction** package is provided below.
