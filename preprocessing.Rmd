The **gapfraction** package requires height-normalized LiDAR points clouds. Users can either provide the path to files or objects following the column order and naming conventions of the **rLiDAR** and **lidR** packages.

By far, the simplest option for pre-processing data is to follow the **lidR** package [tutorial](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR/wiki/lasnormalize), which utilizes **LAStools** under the hood. Alternatively, for LiDAR data without ground point classifications, height-normalized point clouds can be produced either with two **LAStools** command line functions, `lasground` and `lasheight`, or with three functions in **USDA Fusion**, `GroundFilter`, `GridSurfaceCreate`, and `CanopyModel`. If the ground points are already classified then you only need to use the `lasheight` function of **LAStools**, while the process for Fusion still requires the same three functions. Hence, I recommend that you use **LAStools**, as its ground point classification algorithm is also superior to that of **Fusion**, producing more accurate height-normalized point clouds. This is because **Fusion** uses the Kraus and Pfeifer (1998) algorithm^[Kraus and Pfeifer (1998) Determination of terrain models in wooded areas with airborne laser scanner data. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271698000094], while **LAStools** implements an optimized version of the Axelsson (1999) algorithm^[Axelsson (1999) Processing of laser scanner dataâ€”algorithms and applications. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271699000088]. For more information, read Maguya, Junttila, and Kauranne (2014)^[Maguya, Junttila, and Kauranne (2014) http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/6/7/6524]. An example application of `lasground` and `lasheight`, implemented in **Command Prompt** or **Bash**, is provided below.

```
lasground -i lidar.las -o lidar_g.las 
lasheight -i lidar_g.las -o lidar_n.las -replace_z 
```

In order to run these functions, you need to istall **LAStools**. For Windows, don't forget to add the **LAStools** `bin` directory to your system path^[http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm]. For a single LiDAR plot, this is simple to run without leaving your R session. You can call these functions using the `system` function included in base **R**, as shown below.

```
setwd('C:/lidar')
system(lasground -i lidar.las -o lidar_g.las)
system(lasheight -i lidar_g.las -o lidar_n.las -replace_z)
```

To loop through LAS files in a folder, the syntax follows this pseudocode:

```
folder <- 'C:/lidar'
files  <- list.files(folder, pattern="\\.las$", full.names=TRUE)

for (i in 1:length(files)) {
  file   <- files[i]
  basenm <- basename(file)
  filenm <- strsplit(basenm,'.',fixed=TRUE)[[1]][1]
  ground <- paste(folder,filenm,'_ground.las',sep='')
  htnorm <- paste(folder,filenm,'_norm.las',sep='')
  system(paste('lasground -i ',file,' -o ',ground, sep=''))
  while (!file.exists(ground)) { Sys.sleep(1) }
  system(paste('lasheight -i ',ground,' -o ',htnorm,' -replace_z', sep=''))
  while (!file.exists(htnorm)) { Sys.sleep(1) }
}
```
This `for` loop reads each LAS file path, extracts the name of the file without extension, creates the filenames of the ground and height-normalized outputs, executes `lasground`, waits for the output, executes `lasheight` using the ground file as the input, waits for the output, then proceeds to the next iteration. The code should be simple to parallelize using the `foreach` package.

Again, the **lidR** package is recommended for its ease of use.
